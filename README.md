Hello everyone this add-on is a sound gui that plays the Xbox 360 UI Sounds
Little Story
I was extracting an application for the Xbox 360 when i noticed theres the SystemSounds Folder and its contents contains several wav files that plays these sounds
and 21 days later i decied to make this addon for Kodi
Works for Kodi 19 and probably the Kodi 20
